# CodSoft Internship Projects - README

This README provides an overview of the three machine learning projects completed by Shaima during her internship with CodSoft. Each project is centered around a unique application of machine learning, demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project 1: Movie Genre Classification

### Overview
This project aims to classify movies into genres based on their plot summaries. The model is trained to identify patterns in the language used in plot descriptions to accurately predict genres.

### Steps Involved
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and tokenized movie plot summaries, removing any irrelevant or redundant data to enhance feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction:** Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Model Selection:** Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing model.

### Results
The final model achieved high accuracy in classifying movie genres, demonstrating effective feature extraction and model tuning.

## Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction

### Overview
The objective of this project was to predict customer churn for a given dataset. Customer churn prediction helps businesses understand which customers are likely to leave and take preventive actions to retain them.

### Steps Involved
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, converted categorical variables to numerical representations, and normalized the data.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified key factors contributing to customer churn, such as service usage, customer support interactions, and contract type.
- **Model Selection:** Tested algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees to classify customers as likely to churn or remain loyal.
- **Evaluation:** Compared model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC score to select the best model.

### Results
The chosen model provided insightful predictions on customer churn with high accuracy, allowing for proactive customer retention strategies.

## Project 3: Spam SMS Detection

### Overview
The spam SMS detection model is designed to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "legitimate" using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This tool is beneficial for filtering unwanted messages.

### Steps Involved
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed special characters and irrelevant whitespace, then converted text to lowercase for consistency.
- **Feature Extraction:** Used TF-IDF to transform text messages into numerical features representing word importance.
- **Model Selection:** Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and SVM to classify messages.
- **Evaluation:** Measured the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the effectiveness of each model.

### Results
The model achieved a high accuracy rate in distinguishing spam from legitimate SMS messages, making it suitable for practical deployment in SMS filtering systems.
